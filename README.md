# RiveScript Language for Atom

This adds syntax highlighting for the [RiveScript](http://www.rivescript.com/)
chatbot scripting language to the [Atom](https://atom.io/) code editor.

Inspiration was taken from [language-superscript](https://github.com/DBozhinovski/language-superscript)
which was itself auto-converted from a SublimeText plugin.

Contributions are welcome.
